This directory contains manually-recorded slot positions for each of the slots on the shelves (928) taken as of July 10, 2023. These slots are used for the calculation of the collision sphere and top/bottom cylinders, which MATLAB uses to plan robot paths that don't collide with the shelves.

DO NOT use these slots positions as the basis for joint trajectories, since they may not be updated going forward.

ONLY use these for the collision sphere.
